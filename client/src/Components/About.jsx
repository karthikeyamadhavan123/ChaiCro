          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
           ChaiCro was born out of a love for Indian street markets and a desire to make
            these unique shopping experiences accessible to everyone, no matter where they are in
            the world. Our founder, [Your Name], noticed that despite the growing popularity of
            online shopping, there was a gap when it came to finding authentic street fashion
            online. So, in [Year], Dolly Chai Wala was launched to fill that void and to celebrate
            the diversity and creativity of Indian street vendors.
